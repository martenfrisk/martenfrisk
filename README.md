# Hi ðŸ‘‹

I study full stack web development @ Chas Academy. 

Graduating in 2021.


I like React and creating useful but niche SPAs.

Such as podcast transcript search engines or a medieval Korean bureaucracy generator.

## Seekers' Lounge

Search through all episodes of the Teacher's Lounge podcast. Transcribed with AWS Transcribe and search powered by ElasticSearch. 

## Handbook Search

Same as Seekers' Lounge but for Hollywood Handbook.
